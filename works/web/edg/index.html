            No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because
            it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
            pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
            extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
            pain, but because  occasionally circumstances occur in which
            toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
