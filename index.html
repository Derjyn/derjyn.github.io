                        <p>
                            Welcome to the personal page and playground of "Derjyn".  Here you can view my previous
                            projects, take a peek at my laboratory, and find some links to cool places around the 
                            net related to design, coding, or bits I find pure awesome.
                        </p>

                        <h3>About the design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am a sucker for pixel based design, retro 8 and 16bit schemes... The nostalgia of the 
                            old days has never gone away for me. When I approached this personal project, I went in 
                            several different directions at first, until deciding that the site was just that: personal.  
                            Therefore, I needed to actually look inside for a vision that truly had me satisfied.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the major goals was to keep things small and tidy. This meant being on the ball
                            from the start with code in keeping the CSS, Javascript, and HTML minimal and to the point.
                            Outside of the fonts utilized in the site, everything weighs in at around 18KB. Not too shabby. 
                            It's when things start to get "fancy" that any actual size comes into play, such as pictures 
                            or the previously mentioned external fonts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are no actual "pages" that make up the site, rather just one static HTML index file.
                            A bit of Javascript and CSS magic is used to make up the different sections, by way of tabs.
                            This further boosts the speed and minimal goal, by not needed to make new requests for each 
                            page (or section) of the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is still work needed before I am truly happy with everything though. Much more needs 
                            to be done to make the site standards compliant and responsive. More tweaks need to be made 
                            on the performance end. There are also plans for adding some "easter eggs", because I really 
                            enjoy user discovery in code and design. In the end, this is my playground and I will 
                            certainly be playing. Enjoy.

                            Not every wheel needs to be invented, and sometimes other gifted people can do things
                            much better. As such, other resources and tools were wrangled together to make D3 shine
                            as brightly as I envisioned. Here are links to those kind entities.
